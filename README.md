# 📌 Project Title  
🛍️ Retail Product Performance Analysis  

# 📌 Introduction  
This project analyzes retail sales data to understand how different products contribute to revenue and overall business performance. Using Power BI, it identifies top revenue and volume drivers, classifies products as Value Drivers, Volume Drivers, or Supporting Products, and provides actionable insights by store, region, and sales channel.  

The analysis objectives include:
- Summarize product performance with total sales, quantity sold, and average selling price.  
- Identify high-value and high-volume products.  
- Classify products into Value, Volume, and Supporting categories.  
- Analyze performance across stores, regions, and channels.  
- Provide actionable business recommendations.

# 📂 Data Cleaning & Preparation

All datasets (sales and dimension tables) were imported into **Power BI** for cleaning and transformation.  
Several steps were carried out to ensure the data was accurate and analysis-ready.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Overview

| Step | Description | Action Taken |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Data Merging | Combined datasets | Merged all sales datasets into one table |
| Removed Duplicates | Eliminated duplicate records | Removed overall duplicates from the datasets |
| Checked for Blanks | Ensured data completeness | Checked for blanks in key columns |
| Data Type Validation | Ensured correct formats | Converted `order_datetime` to Date/Time and `order_date` to Date |
| Header Correction | Fixed column naming issues | Set the first row as headers in **Dim Regional Manager** table |

These steps ensured all datasets were clean, consistent, and ready for modeling and visualization in Power BI.

## ⚙️ Calculated Fields & Measures

To enable advanced time-based and performance analysis, calculated tables, columns, and measures were created in Power BI.

### 📅 Calculated Table

A dedicated **Date Table** was created to support time intelligence analysis.

**Table Name:** `DateTable`  
**Calculated Columns Created:**

These tools helped streamline **data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization** throughout the project lifecycle.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to **understand patterns, distributions, and relationships** in the data before deeper analysis. The focus was on visual exploration and identifying areas of interest.

### 📊 Areas Explored

| Analysis Area | Focus |
|---------------|--------|
| Overall Business Performance | Evaluated total sales, total quantity sold, and ASP trends |
| Product Performance | Examined top and low-performing products by revenue and volume |
| Product Classification | Observed distribution across Value, Volume, and Supporting products |
| Order Type Analysis | Compared single items vs combos |
| Channel Performance | Visualized revenue contribution by Dine-in, Takeaway, Delivery, Drive-thru |
| Regional Distribution | Compared sales patterns across regions |
| Store Performance | Reviewed revenue and transactions by store |
| Time-Series Trends | Visualized monthly revenue and quantity trends |

EDA helped shape **dashboard design, KPI selection, and analytical focus**.

## 📊 Statistical Analysis

To complement EDA, **quantitative metrics and comparisons** were calculated to measure performance and growth more formally.

### 🔢 Methods Applied

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Percentage Change | Measured Year-on-Year (YoY) growth in revenue and quantity |
| Ranking Analysis | Ranked products, categories, and regions by revenue or quantity |
